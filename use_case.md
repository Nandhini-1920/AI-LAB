## Use Case 1 – Maze Navigation System
Link:
https://github.com/Nandhini-1920/AI-LAB/blob/main/maze.py

This application simulates a real-world maze navigation system.
Each cell in the maze is a node, and each possible move is an edge.

BFS is used to find the shortest path from the start to the goal.
DFS is used to explore possible paths in a depth-first manner.

This represents:
- Robot navigation
- Game AI movement
- GPS routing
- Path planning

## Use Case 2 – 8-Puzzle Problem Solver
Link:
https://github.com/Nandhini-1920/AI-LAB/blob/main/puzzle2.py

This application simulates the classic 8-puzzle problem.
Each tile configuration is a state, and each move is an action.

BFS is used to find the solution with the minimum number of moves.
DFS is used to explore move sequences deeply to reach the goal state.

This represents:
- Automated planning
- Problem solving
- State-space search
- Optimization problems

## Use Case 3 – AI Search Visualizer
Link:
https://github.com/Nandhini-1920/AI-LAB/blob/main/ai_search_visualizer.py

This application simulates a real-world graph traversal scenario.
Nodes represent locations and edges represent paths between them.

BFS is used to find the shortest path to a target node.
DFS is used to explore possible paths in a depth-first manner.

This represents:
- Pathfinding in games
- Robot navigation
- Network exploration
- AI-based decision-making systems
